# Thermail debugger

This is a tool to visualize and debug thermails prediction algorithm.

## Background
While we were developing an algorithm for predicting thermails, which should be of use for paragliders, we decided that we need a tool to simplify data visualization and debugging.
So we developed this simple solution, mainly expired by xcglobe.com.

## How it works
There are a couple of scripts that convert flight data from xcglobe.com and thermail prediction algorithm to the format acceptable by the tool.

## How to use
Use "A", "D" keys to make "glider" move.
It will display track info like current point details, calculated thermails info.
Also you could use altitude chart at the bottom to move "glider".

## Disclaimer
Don't look at source code unless you have a good insurance that will cover possible mental harm. 
This tool was written in a hurry, and JS/CSS/HTML are not my strong points.
Maybe I'll refactor it in the future, but for now you could use it 'as is', if you really need to.
